> **_Task: PRFAQ for Happioh_**

Part One: _In order to better describe the Happioh value prop, Jonathan Berger asked me to write up a PRFAQ exercise, imagining “If Happioh were shipping tomorrow, how might we position it to the market?”_ 

Part Two: The second part of the project involves brainstorming external and internal questions and answering to the best of my ability. Note: this stage is a work in progress. 

See my work here: [Happioh PR FAQs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18WLp2UWJhtGgY_Rq0nqBcBQuh_BI9VQyi5SXNnuztTo/edit?ts=604f9a16#)
