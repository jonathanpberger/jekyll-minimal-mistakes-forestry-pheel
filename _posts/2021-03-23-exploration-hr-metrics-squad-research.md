title: 'Exploration: HR Metrics & Squad Research'

> **Task:** Jonathan asked me to do a quick search for HR analytics and any consumer-friendly “squad” software that may already exist. 

**See the working document:** [**HR Analytics & Squad Research**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cj1o63UEV8qP7M0ZWw0tyic1fF37vx2TL3a6E099pNA/edit?usp=sharing)**.**

I did not find anything that looks like our squad mock-up. Still, I did discover the Interpersonal Dynamics Inventory (IDI) and DARMA software that will be useful for future brainstorming and iterations of our squad feature. I also shared a stellar whitepaper on the current status of teams (linked in the working document) in our #reading-list Slack channel. 

Following up on a previous task, I looked for research-backed sources to add to our understanding of meeting health. A few terms like _social loafing_ and the _contagion effect_ (regarding mood mirroring at the beginning of meetings) may be worth looking into. 

I assume the team is already aware, but I stumbled across a competitor called [Happeo](https://www.happeo.com/?utm%20|%20term=happeo&utm%20|%20medium=ppc&utm%20|%20campaign=usa%2520%7C%2520Brand&utm%20|%20source=adwords&hsa%20|%20cam=1462879604&hsa%20|%20src=g&hsa%20|%20mt=e&hsa%20|%20ver=3&hsa%20|%20net=adwords&hsa%20|%20tgt=kwd-472204040336&hsa%20|%20acc=1105594464&hsa%20|%20grp=81556614204&hsa%20|%20kw=happeo&hsa%20|%20ad=393992429640&utm_term=happeo&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=usa+%7C+Brand+%7C+Desktop+%5BE%5D&utm_source=adwords&hsa_cam=1462879604&hsa_src=g&hsa_mt=e&hsa_ver=3&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_tgt=kwd-472204040336&hsa_acc=1105594464&hsa_grp=81556614204&hsa_kw=happeo&hsa_ad=393992429640&gclid=CjwKCAjwgOGCBhAlEiwA7FUXkh_Uc8yXtgnavgVj1WB25ihyVgvRx9t_DWBjEOxuzue--QB2sHwA-BoCsZcQAvD_BwE). I think it's important that we develop a unique brand voice, so it's good to keep tabs on how this company is branding itself!
