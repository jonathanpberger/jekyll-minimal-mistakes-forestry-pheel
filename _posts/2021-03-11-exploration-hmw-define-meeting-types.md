> **Task #2:** What research exists around meeting types (e.g., deliberative, informational, bonding)? Can we ground this in the literature?

I found a great resource: Lucid Meetings which breaks down 16 meeting types, provides worksheets, and workshops. These were all documented in a google sheet. Will do more research soon to cover more bases.
