title: 'Experiment: Pixar Pitch for Happioh'
excerpt_separator: ''

---
**TASK:** Timebox \~30-45 to sketching out one (or a few) Pixar Pitches to see if they are useful when telling the Happioh story. Start by plugging some Epics (e.g., Squads, Agendas, etc.).

This was a tad harder than expected... I'm not sure if I added enough detail to each Epic to make this work of value. That said, I always enjoy a creative writing assignment! 

It is important to keep our customers in mind, so hopefully, (at the very least) this helps bring a new perspective to the pain-points our users are currently experiencing.
