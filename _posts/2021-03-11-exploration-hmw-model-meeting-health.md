**Task #1:** HMW model meeting health? Thereâ€™s timeliness, but what else?

I found a ton of research regarding the rather "subjective" quality of interpersonal dynamics contributing to meeting health. There are fewer objective measurements of meeting health (that I know of so far). I'd like to do a deeper dive soon.  

I set out to gather research addressing Task #1 outlined below. [See document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1glZ2PviQ7kT2MZT5VA2loXoY1eXXRENxsEB7NLrJVFY/edit#heading=h.fgs60qanybc8).
