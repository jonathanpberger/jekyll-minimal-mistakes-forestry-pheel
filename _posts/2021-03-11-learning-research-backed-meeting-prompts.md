# Task: Research Meeting Prompts

[Jon asked me to look into meeting prompts (ideally research-backed).](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1glZ2PviQ7kT2MZT5VA2loXoY1eXXRENxsEB7NLrJVFY/edit?disco=AAAAH-CgXZ8) I found an AWESOME resource: [Range.co](https://www.range.co/). They specialize in developing meeting/ company culture. I pulled research-backed meeting prompts from their E-book.
